### How to Inspect 

For details on all major browsers with screenshots refer to this [blog post on inspecting code in different browsers](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-to-inspect).

In most browsers it is right click and choose *Inspect* from that menu

If you use safari:
- go to the top of the window
- Safari >settings > advanced
- check the box for  "show web  developer..."
- then 2 finger press for right click and choose **Inspect Element**

## Assessment 

At 3pm, you can switch to the quiz on brightspace even if the activity is not quite done, or you can work on that until you are done because it will help with the following graded assessment. 

- I recommend inspecting the [quiz hints](hints.md) before you begin the quiz
- it is timed, 30 minutes
- the quiz is open notes
- you have **one** try, no retakes
- 10 questions, multiple choice
- the hints do not deduct points
