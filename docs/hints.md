# Hints and Tips

_you can use this quiz to build some basic debugging/study skills_ 

1. Use your examples! Use `inspect` on code we have seen, another website you have been to before, or even this page to see if you can find the thing the question is about
2. Use your notes from during the lesson, always make note of new vocab terms when instructors say them.
3. Try things on codepen to see if options do anyting or not
